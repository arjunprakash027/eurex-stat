# eurex-stat

[Euraxess](https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/jobs/search) is a European platform that connects researchers with job opportunities across universities, research institutions, and industry. It serves as a central hub for research-related career openings, covering multiple fields and countries. The platform is maintained by the European Commission and supports international mobility and career development for researchers.

This project is built around the goal of extracting and analyzing data from the Euraxess job portal to better understand academic hiring trends, demand across research fields, geographic distribution, and more.

## Project Overview

This repository is structured around three main goals:

1. **Data Collection**  
   Extract job listings from the Euraxess portal on a regular basis.

2. **Data Analysis** *(in progress)*  
   Apply statistical and exploratory methods to uncover patterns in the academic and research job market across Europe.
